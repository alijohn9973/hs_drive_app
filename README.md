HS Drive - Full Project (Driver + Rider)

This is a minimal scaffold that contains:
- Flutter project placeholder suitable for Rider + Driver flows
- main.dart with role selection
- simple screens for Rider Home and Driver Home
- config.dart to set BACKEND_URL and GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY

How to use:
1. Unzip the project
2. Open in Android Studio or VS Code
3. Replace BACKEND_URL and GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY in lib/config.dart
4. Run `flutter pub get`
5. Run on an emulator/device

Note: This is a scaffold (no real backend). Use with the Node backend we created or a mock server.
